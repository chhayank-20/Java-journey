Q.1 : what do wrapper classes do ?
wrapper classes convert the primitive datatypes to objects , so that different operations can be performed on it. we can also convert objects to primitive datatypes . 
this process are called Autoboxing and Unboxing .

Q.2 : 2. List the eight primitive data types in Java.
int , short , byte , long , float , double , char  ,String ; 

Q.3  Why do we need Wrapper classes?
To convert the primitive datatypes to objects for performing operations on it .

Q.4. What is autoboxing?
The process of converting a primitive data to an object is called autoboxing , it is done by wrapper classes in java . 

Q.5. What is unboxing?
The process of converting objects to primitive data in java through wrapper classes is called unboxing.

Q.6. Explain the purpose of the valueOf() method in Wrapper classes.
There are 2 purpose of method valueOf() in java : 
1. Rather then Character class of Wrapper classes , every other class of it has a static method valueOf() which converts the primitive data to objetct . other classes like : Integer , Short , Byte, Float, Double , Long, String .
2. this method is used for unboxig , which means to convert the object back to primitive data .

Q.7. Differentiate between == and equals() when comparing Wrapper objects.
== operator gives the boolean value which tells weather the Two objects are pointing to same memory location or not ?
.equals() method also gives boolean value , which tells weather the data of the object is same .

Q.8. Can you explain the significance of the hashCode() method
in Wrapper classes?
The hashCode() method gives a unique inteer hashcode value based on the objects state.  it helps in the fast retrivel of objects in collections , like Hashmap , Hashset ,HashTable .  this method is overided for proper working of these collections .
The hashcode() method ensures that object with same values get same hashcode .

Q.9. How can you convert a Wrapper object to a primitive data type?
To convert a wapper object to primitive datatype, we use different methods like :  for integer : .intValue();
for double  : .doubleValue();   (eg: obj.doubleValue();)
for float   : .floatValue() ;  ..... etc .

Q.10 .Discuss the parseInt() method in the Integer class.
The parseInt() method of the integer class is used to convert string to int ( primitive data ).

Q.11. Explain the compareTo() method in the Comparable interface.
compareTo() method is a part of comparable interface in java , which compares the objects and give outcome as an integer.  Outcome of obj1.compareTo(obj2); : 
+ve  :  means the obj1 is greater . 
if obj1 and obj2 are string then it will compare them through their ASCII values .
-ve  :  means the obj2 is greater .
0    :  means value of both is same .

Q.12. How do you check if a given string is a valid representation of a particular primitive type?
By using the .isPrimitive() method. it gives boolean value , true means the object is a primitive datatype , and false means not a primitive datatype.
we can also use to string method , if it dosent throw exceptions , that means we successfully converted object to primitive string.

Q. 13. Explain the purpose of the Boolean class in Java.
Boolean class is one of the wrapper classes in java. it convert the primitive boolean value to object. 

Q.15. How can you convert a boolean primitive to a Boolean object?
By the use of wrapper class. by using the .valueOf() method of  Boolean class.
eg: Boollean bool = .valueOf(true);

Q.16. Explain the toString() method in Wrapper classes. 
.toString() method is used to convert the object to string , which is useful for printing the data . 

Q.20. How can you convert a Wrapper object to a String?
we can convert a wrapper object to a string by 2 ways : 
1. by using the .toString() method .
2. by concatenating the object with an empty string . 

Q.21. Explain the toBinaryString() method in the Integer class.
The .toBinaryString() method convets the Integer class (object) to the string representation of base2 Integer value . 

Q.22. What is the purpose of the MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE constants in Wrapper classes?
The constants MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE defined in Integer class in java. value of MAX_VALUE is maximum value of (primitive datatype) integer  and MIN_VALUE has the minimum value of (primitive datatype) integer. 

Q.23. Discuss the parsexxx() methods in Wrapper classes.
There are 7 types of parse method , and these methods are used to convert the string data to other primitive data . 
eg : .parseInt() method to convert to integer. 
.parseDouble() method to converet ti double datatype.
.. and ohters.

Q.24. How can you create a BigInteger object from a String?
BigInteger is a class of math package  in java . and this class provides methods to convert the String to different number system , like : binary, decimal, number,octal, hexadecimal.

Q.26. Explain the valueOf() method in the BigDecimal class.
The valueOf() method is of BigDecimal class of math package of java is used to make long decimal objects. it is used for big calculations like financial calculations for correctness.
The valueOf() method takes long datatype as parameter and convert that into BigDecimal object .
we can also give parameter for how many decimal point we want our BigDecimal object to be .

Q.28. Can you use Wrapper classes in a switch statement?
yes , we can use wapper classes i switch statement . but we can only use : Byte , Character , Integer and Short.
