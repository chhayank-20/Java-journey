1) What is Object oriented? Write down difference b/w Object oriented and procedure oriented programming approach.

object orineted is a style in programming that is used for better code writing , as it increases the understanding of the code and reuablity . it binds the data with methods ,which increase the safety of the data.
The Object Oriented programming has 6 pillers : 
(a) Abstraction - Hinding the unneccessory details from the user .                                                                           (b) Inheritence - a process in which , we extends a parent class to child class ,  for using the properties and methods of parent class. Three ways of Inheritence is (i) Single level         (ii) multi level          (iii) Hierarchical level                                                                            (c) Polymorphism  - is a concept in which we make the various implementaion of a single method . that means a method have  various forms/ implemations .
# method overloading is a also a concept that is achved through polymorphism .     Polymorphism can be achived through 3 ways :
(i) by changing parameter Type      (ii)  by changing the order of parameter       (iii)  by changing the number of parameter in method .                            (d)class  -  class is a block of code that contains of methods and  members .it it it is like a templete to store methods and members.                               (eg - human )                           (e) Object  - object is the refrence variable of a class to call the methods and members of a class .   (eg - name )           (f) Encapsulation 
Benifits of using OOPS : Reuablity , Efficiet , Secure , Flexiblity 

In Procedure oriented :
(a) Secquence of steps are taken to solve a problem.
(b) it is difficult to reuse code in it.
(c) it is less secure .
(d) it is mostly used in small programs .
(e) it has functions to implemat various tasks .

In Object Oriented : 
(a) it is more secure .
(b) it has code reuablity.
(c) In OOPS objects are used to bind data and methods for more security .
(d) it is used in more complex programs .
(e) it has 6 implemations - inheritence , Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation , class, object.



2) What is class and object? Explain all oop features in java with example.

An Object is an instance of a class , Every object has its own instance members when it is initilized . objects have privite properties called instance members .
object is used to call the vaious methods and members of a class. 
there can be (n) numbers of objects of a class .

OOP features :
(a) Abstraction - Hinding the unneccessory details from the user . (eg - we Know that car runs when we give accleator ,but we dont know how it  really runs its engie and how car    works )                                                                          (b) Inheritence - a process in which , we extends a parent class to child class ,  for using the properties and methods of parent class. Three ways of Inheritence is (i) Single level         (ii) multi level          (iii) Hierarchical            level                                                                               (c) Polymorphism  - is a concept in which we make the various implementaion of a single method . that means a method have  various forms/ implemations .
# method overloading is a also a concept that is achved through polymorphism .     Polymorphism can be achived through 3 ways :
(i) by changing parameter Type      (ii)  by changing the order of parameter       (iii)  by changing the number of parameter in method .                            (d)class  -  class is a block of code that contains of methods and  members .it it it is like a templete to store methods and members.                               (eg - human )                           (e) Object  - object is the refrence variable of a class to call the methods and members of a class .   (eg - name )           (f) Encapsulation 



3)What are the role of setter and getter method ? What is POJO In Java.

Role of setter metod is to set the value of a instance member of an object , and
Role of getter method is to get the value of an instance member of an object .

POJO in full plain old java ibject , are the java objects that are not bound to any framework or library ,
POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java class that:

Has private attributes.
Uses getters and setters for attribute access.
Doesn't have complex logic or inheritance requirements.


4) How to update and retrive  the value of a particular property of an object from anothor class(Let suppose the property is private) ?

Getters and Setters: Create public getter and setter methods in the class with the private property to allow controlled access.
Pass Object as Argument: Pass the object containing the private property as an argument to the other class's method.
Use Getters and Setters: Inside the other class's method, use the object's getter to retrieve the private property value and setter to update it.


5)Create an Object having two properties and four behaviours
(add,substract,multiply,divide) to perform desired operation.object must have setter and getter and keep all properties private.

6) What is Constructor? List down the keypoints about constructor.

A constructor in Java is a special method with the same name as the class that gets called automatically when you create an object. Here are the key points:
Initialization: Constructors are used to initialize the object's state (set starting values for its properties).
No return type: Constructors don't have a return type (not even void).
Implicit vs. Explicit: Java provides a default constructor if you don't define one explicitly.
Can have parameters: You can define constructors with parameters to allow passing initial values during object creation.



7) Can we make multiple contructor inside a class? if yes then what is the need of it.Explain

Java allows constructor overloading, where you can define multiple constructors in a class. Each constructor can have different parameters (number or type) to provide flexibility in object creation.
it helps in :
Different Initialization Options: You can create constructors with or without parameters to cater to different object initialization scenarios.
Default Values: You can provide a constructor with default values for some parameters, allowing users to optionally specify them.
Code Readability: It can improve code readability by making object creation clear based on the arguments provided.


8) Private constuctor is legal or illegal ?

private constructors are legal.  it helps in : 
Control Object Creation: It prevents other classes from directly creating objects of your class, enforcing controlled initialization or use through factory methods.
Singletons: Private constructors are often used with the singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of a class exists.


9) What is Singleton class explain with suitable example?

A singleton class in Java ensures only one instance of that class ever exists throughout the program. It provides a global access point to that single instance.

10) What is method overloading ? What are importance of method overloading ? Can we overload the main method in java ?
Method Overloading:
Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type).
Allows performing the same operation on different data types or with different numbers of arguments.
Importance:
Improves code readability: Makes code more intuitive by using the same method name for related operations with distinct arguments.
Flexibility: Enables using the same method name for actions that differ based on the provided data.
Main Method Overloading:
The main method has a specific signature (public static void main(String[] args)) to be recognized as the program entry point.


11) How to pass as many argument to java method?

with the help of var-arg.
